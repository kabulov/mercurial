had to create a repository and grant access to developers through local network.

infrastructure was set up already, just had to do all that on my own.

repository is called 'repo'

1) mkdir /path/to/repository/repo
2) cd /path/to/repository/repo
3) hg init
4) cp or add any files you need
5) hg add .
6) hg commit -u "comment"
7) chown -R apache:apache /path/to/repository/repo
8) mcedit /etc/conf.d/hg-server
9) add repo, assign new corresponding ip, remember it
10) mcedit /etc/apache2/sitelets/repository.site
11) edit file according to new ip you set, and look at samples of other repositories there
12) /etc/init.d/hg-server restart
13) /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

if one pushes now from outside of this computer (on which repo is presiding)
one will get 'http error: 403 (ssl required)'
thus

14) create /path/to/repository/repo/.hg/hgrc
15) edit :
      [web]
      encoding = UTF-8
      push_ssl = false
      allow_push = *

notes:
1. ip:port you assigned may be in use, kill the process which is using it
